        <h2>LangApp</h2>
        <p>
            A language learning app with customisable courses. The app contains video, audio, and text explanations, reading and listening tests, word cards, and translation exercises. Later versions of the app will also have some unique lesson types such as writing tests (essays, which are going to be checked automatically), speaking practice (with an AI), and others. (the background image hasn't been updated to the actual state of the app yet)

        <h2>Cygni</h2>
        <p>
            Cygni is a multi-paradigm programming language meant to allow for easy and safe multi-platform app development without significant performance loss. Its standard library is rather large and behaves the same way on all of the supported environments. The only intended use of the language is the development of multi-platform applications.

    <div class="qupl">
        <h2>QUPL</h2>
        <p>
            QUPL is a purely imperative programming language made for systems programming. Its main focuses are safety and performance. The standard library of this language is very small, as it's primarily made for programming in freestanding environments.
