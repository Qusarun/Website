        <h1>What is QUPL?</h1>
        <p>
            QUPL is an imperative programming language focusing primarily on safety, performance, and ease of use. Originally, I started working on it as a tool for my own projects, but I've decided to publish it now.
        </p>
        <h1>What can QUPL be used for?</h1>
        <p>
            The intended usages of QUPL are operating systems, compilers, emulators, and other lower level programs. You should NOT use this language for high level programs such as desktop and mobile applications, algorithms, or others. There are a lot of languages that are significantly better for such use cases. Another one of my languages, Cygni, is one of them.
        </p>
        <h1>What is the QUPL syntax like?</h1>
        <p>
            QUPL has a mix C and x86-64 Assembly syntax with some elements from Kotlin, BASIC, and a few other programming languages.
        </p>
        <h1>Does QUPL have classes?</h1>
        <p>
            No, the closest thing QUPL has to classes is structs. However, because of the existence of extension functions, it's fully possible to do OOP. I don't encourage it though.
